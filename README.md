-Tile sets for maps
-main Player concepts to be voted on (once we decide what we generally want

## Music
MUSIC EVERYWHERE

## Coding
Javascript scripts to expand the mechanics of our game.

## Slave labor
Placing resources into the repository and correctly labeling them for use.

## Groups within our group
We will be breaking up the world map, and will need people to organize into smaller groups to fulfill that under some sort of lead. while that won't be for a few days, keep that in mind.

## Shitposters
-Lazy "Ideasguys" for inspiration
-people need to say we aren't going to finish so we can make them feel dumb when we finish
-people getting mad that their idea wasn't popular and making anger rants so we can laugh at them.
